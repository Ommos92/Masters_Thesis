\section{Communication Systems}
As modern communication systems move towards the deployment of 6G networks, the need for efficient and reliable communication systems has become increasingly important. The use of machine learning techniques in communication systems has been shown to improve the performance of wireless communication systems by optimizing the use of resources and reducing the latency of data transmission.

To address challenges in 6G communication systems novel techniques such as reconfigurable intilligence surfaces (RISs), integrated sensing and communication, mmWave and THz networks, and other methods have been proposed. \cite{zhou2023survey} Although these methods demonstrate satisfactory performance towards 6G requirements, the requirements for network management have increased in complexity and scale. The future 6G networks have leveraged machine learning (ML) as promising solution to network management techniques which optimize the use of resources and reduce the latency of data transmission. \cite{zhou2024large}
